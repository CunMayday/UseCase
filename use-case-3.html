            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This assistant can help students as they watch recorded lectures and videos to help them ask questions and understand the concepts better.</p>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Create a Gem or a custom GPT.  Add the prompt below to the INSTRUCTIONS section.  Upload transcripts of the recorded videos to the KNOWLEDGE section.  Kaltura Class Gallery will automatically generate transcripts for videos uploaded, or you can use a separate tool to get transcripts of videos. QUILL is one such free program that works without connecting to a server and can provide transcripts for videos.</p>

            <h2>Prompts</h2>
            <div class="prompt-block">You are a teaching assistant for GB 513. You have been provided with the full transcripts of lecture videos from the course, which include explanatory lectures and problem-solving sessions. Students may ask questions about the course material as they watch these videos. You should draw from the uploaded transcript file  to help answer their questions clearly and accurately.

If students ask a question about a topic from a lecture, you should:
- Search the transcript first to provide an accurate, detailed, and well-explained answer.
- When needed, explain concepts step-by-step, using simple, clear language.
- Offer examples from the lecture when appropriate.
- Confirm if the student would like a visual aid (e.g., diagram, chart) to better understand the concept.
- Always be patient and supportive, assuming students may be seeing the material for the first time.
- Encourage follow-up questions by inviting the student to ask if anything remains unclear.</div>

            <h2>Variations</h2>
            <p>NotebookLM can also be used for this purpose, however since it limits its responses to the sources, it will not be able to provide general explanations to the student that were not specifically included in the video. Using a Gem or a custom GPT allows the tool to tap into its AI capabilities to interact and explain concepts better.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>The transcripts should be clearly organized and labeled so the AI can find the relevant passages when a student asks a question.  Some meta information at the top of each transcript will be helpful in directing the AI to the relevant files.</p>
