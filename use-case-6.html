            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>To provide students with audio summaries of course content that they can listen to whenever and wherever they want.  Faculty typically do not have PDF copies of the textbooks, but the publishers often provide presentation files for each of the chapters.  These can be used as a good source to help students familiarize themselves with the content.</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Create a new notebook in Notebook LM. Upload the publisher provided presentation slides for the book. Select only one of the chapter slides and deselect all others. On the right side under AUDIO OVERVIEW, click on CUSTOMIZE and enter the prompt below.
Once Audio is generated, download the audio file.  It will be in .wav format.  It can be converted to .mp3 format to reduce file size and make it compatible with all mobile devices. Instructions for doing so are elsewhere in this guide.  
Upload the audio file to your course.</p>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Prompts</h2>
            <div class="prompt-block">“Stick close to the source material.  Avoid digressions and banter unless they directly relate to the source material.  Cover each slide one by one.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Variations</h2>
            <p>Try changing the audio instructions to one person lecturing and the other asking questions, or ask the presenters to make jokes.</p>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>Emphasize to students that these audio overviews are not meant to replace actual reading of the chapters, but they can make the reading go faster and be more effective.  These overviews can be a good use of their time when they are able to listen to audio but are busy with something else.

Some chapter presentations can be 40-60 slides.  In these cases, it is advisable to remove the direction to cover each slide.</p>
