# features
Do not include react or similar advanced components unless specifically instructed.  The app must be able to run in a standard browser environment based on css, javascript, html and so on.

# updates
 Every time you make a change to a file, add a comment at the beginning of the code that includes the version number and a brief summary of the latest changes made.  Increment the version number by one if it already exists.

# context tracking
Every time you run a task and make changes or answer a question, update the file prompts.md with two pieces of information.  1) The exact prompt you received from me.  2) A list of changes you made or the answer you gave in response. Include which agent you are (Codex, Claude, Gemini Jules, etc).

**IMPORTANT:** Latest changes must be added to the TOP of the prompts.md file, not the bottom. The counter should increment upward with each new task. For example, if the latest entry is "## 5. Feature X", the next entry should be "## 6. Feature Y" and should be placed ABOVE entry #5.

If the prompts.md file doesn't exist yet, then create it first. The purpose of this file is to keep track of what the user requested and what has been done so that the context is always available for review.
