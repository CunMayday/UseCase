            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Faculty and staff have to deal with large amounts of information- for faculty this could relate to preparing for research or staying current with new developments in their fields. For staff, this could be keeping up with policies and managing incoming work to be processed and completed.  A notebook in Notebook LM can support users by helping them find information they need among the many documents they accumulate and summarize new documents as they come in.  These notes can be saved for easy reference later.</p>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Create a new notebook in Notebook LM. Depending on the specific need, upload journal articles, documents shared by coworkers, news, policy announcements and so on.  Create a repository of information around a specific purpose.</p>

        <div class="section-block">
            <h2>Prompts</h2>
            <div class="prompt-block">For research:  From these source articles, provide a summary of the debate around the integration of AI and the issues dealing with academic integrity.  Group the arguments from each of the sources into various camps, then describe the evidence supporting each camp.  Provide an APA style list of references after the summary.

For following guidelines:  I need the latest policy in how to handle academic integrity violations.  Give me the latest recommendations and provide the sources.</div>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>Key to success here will be to build a good knowledge base- Notebook LM excels in dealing with large amounts of information, but do not include sources that are not as reliable as others, because they will all be used with equal weight.</p>
