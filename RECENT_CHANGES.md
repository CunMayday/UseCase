# Recent Changes Summary

## Latest Session Changes (Ready to Commit)

### 1. Fixed Orphan Document Bug (CRITICAL FIX)
**Files:** `editor.js`

**Problem:** When creating a new use case, if image upload failed, a temporary document with `{ temp: true }` was left in Firestore. This caused crashes in sorting and PDF export because code assumed all documents have a `title` field.

**Solution:**
- Track when a new document is created (`isNewDocument` flag)
- If any upload fails or error occurs, delete the temporary document
- Cleanup happens in 3 places: setup upload error, use upload error, and main catch block

**Commit Message:**
```
Fix orphaned document cleanup on failed uploads

Prevent database corruption when image uploads fail during use case creation.
Previously, temporary documents were left in Firestore when uploads failed,
causing crashes in sorting and PDF export due to missing title fields.

Changes:
- Track new document creation with isNewDocument flag
- Delete temporary document if setup screenshot upload fails
- Delete temporary document if use screenshot upload fails
- Delete temporary document if any unexpected error occurs
- Move docId and isNewDocument outside try block for catch access

This prevents crashes when sorting by title (.localeCompare on undefined)
and PDF export (.length on undefined).
```

### 2. Updated .gitignore
**Files:** `.gitignore`

**Changes:** Added utility/maintenance scripts to ignore list:
- add_timestamps.html
- test_timestamps.html
- cleanup_orphaned_docs.html

**Commit Message:**
```
Add utility scripts to .gitignore

Ignore one-time maintenance/diagnostic scripts:
- add_timestamps.html (already run)
- test_timestamps.html (diagnostic tool)
- cleanup_orphaned_docs.html (maintenance tool)
```
